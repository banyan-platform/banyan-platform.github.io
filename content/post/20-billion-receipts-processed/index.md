At noon today, the Banyan Platform processed its 20 **billionth** receipt!

This milestone is particularly poignant for the Banyan Engineering team. When we announced the first version of our platform three years ago, it was not merely a v1 release that demonstrated the viability of our architectural designs. It was a declaration of optimism: the intent to service a global need for better receipt and SKU data. While we continue to add new features for our customers and make performance improvements, that core design and our original technical goals have remained the same. Our vision has been validated and we look forward to the 200 billionth!
