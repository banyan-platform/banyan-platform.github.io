Effective today, Principal Engineer Duncan McGreggor has been promoted to VP of Engineering, and our beloved Staff Engineer Billy Hand has been promoted to Principal Engineer. This was done in recognition of their hard work, engineering excellence, and exceptional commitment to the success of Banyan.

Given the small size of the team and the importance of continued distributed systems work on the Banyan Platform, day-to-day duties will remain essentially the same for both engineers, while each will be taking on additional responsibilities associated with their new roles.
