Effective today, Principal Engineer Duncan McGreggor has been promoted to VP of Engineering, and our beloved Staff Engineer Billy Hand has been promoted to Principal Engineer. Given the small size of the team and the importance of continued distributed systems work on the Banyan Platform, day-to-day duties will remain essentially the same for both engineers.
