# Notes on weights:
#
# The following approach to weight values are experimental and up for discussion, change, etc.
#
# Also, I feel that the developer of this site template may have used the wrong term ... Either have the higher number contribute more weight, or use a term like "inverse-weight" ;-)
#
# 1 - needed for high-visibility posts that focus on customer-facing engineering work
# 5 - good for posts on internal tooling, process, insights on how we work
# 10 - used for good news around our people: hires, promotions, etc.
# 20 - used for sad news, like departures
#
# Lastly, delete any comments in this metadata section before publishing ...

As of today, Jason and Trevor are taking on additional engineering management responsibilities with new direct reports! While a nice side-benefit for Duncan is load-sharing management work, the motivation behind this move is for the whole team to better support each other with individuals' professional and career goals. Jason managed the UI team previously here at Banyan, when we had more folks working on the frontend, and both Jason and Trevor were managers at MediaMath.

Big props to rest of the engineers on the team who supported this so whole-heartedly (i.e., all of them!) and didn't bat an eye at the additional management structure, knowing how beneficial this with be for these two beloved peers :-D
