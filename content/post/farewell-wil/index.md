Today was the last day of Banyan's first CTO, Wil Schobeiri. Wil laid the foundations of Banyan's big data and distributed systems architecture, in concert with Billy Hand -- both working day and night to convert early-stage demo software into a sustainable system capable of handling millions of transactions, receipts, and item-level data.

Many of us have worked with Wil in previous endeavors and have formed strong professional and personal bonds with him. He is not only a gifted technology and product industry leader, he is also a connoisseur of fine wines, accomplished musician, and dear friend to us all.

We wish him luck in his new adventures in Europe, improving the technology and teams there as he has done here!
