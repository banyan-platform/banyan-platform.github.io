With Winter over and a new retail season in full swing, we need more SRE talent and hard work to help distribute the load. In Eric, we have this and more! Another former MediaMather (and, like Billy, former Walmart engineer) Eric brings us his extensive reliability background, passion for stable products, and dedication to getting the job done! Rumour has it that he's also an accomplished martial artist (_very_ accomplished)!
