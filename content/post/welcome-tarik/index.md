As our team and software grows -- and given that we're now running in production -- our first SRE joins us to keep us on the straight and narrow! Another gifted coworker from MediaMath, Tarik has been the driving force behind keeping countless services and their deployments stable and performant. In fact, he kindly volunteered some of his time when Banyan first started preparing its prototype software for production deployments in GCP!
