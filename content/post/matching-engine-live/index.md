From day one, our Data Scientist Ryan Walsh has been working non-stop on turning a very rough prototype for receipt-and-transaction mapping to a full-fledged, maths-based matching engine for merchants and financial institutions who have partnered together. Not only has all Ryan's hard work paid off with a full live deployment and integration into our data pipeline (for processing merchant data), but today marks the first match processed with new in-coming data.

We have many new capabilities and features planned for the matching engine, and each will continue to push Banyan further into new territory, leading our industry with its technical innovations!
