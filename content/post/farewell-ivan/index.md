Today we bid farewell to Ivan Canales, the sole engineer remaining from the pre-CTO days of Banyan, when the initial concept of the technology stack was implemented as a Node.js app. Ivan played a crucial role in supporting the team as they migrated from Node.js to Go, and from AWS to GCP. Ivan remained a committed member of the team -- and sole remaining engineer of Banyan's early days -- learning a great deal and sharing his amazing and uplifting qualities with the rest of our Engineering team.

You will be missed, dear friend!
