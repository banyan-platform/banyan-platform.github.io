Today, the web application Jason Delia has been developing has transitioned to v1, and it will soon be available to our customers. He has shared that the journey of building this application from the ground up has been incredibly gratifying, largely because of the intriguing and demanding problems we've been tackling.

Additionally, it has been an absolute blast for him to be working with the Remix web framework. Jason has been building web applications his entire career and says with confidence and delight that Remix is the best framework he has ever used. It seamlessly integrates modern web application techniques while adhering to well-established web standards. The documentation is easy to understand and there are great tutorials out there by Ryan Florence and Kent C. Dodds which were super helpful in the early stages of development. He absolutely recommends it to anyone!
