Today day marked the first one-on-one meeting for Ben as head of IT with Duncan (CTO), representing some new structure in the org with IT dotted-lining into Engineering.

At Banyan, we are not only passionate about creating great software for our customers and partners, but also setting up all of our employees with the tools they need to be happy in their workflows and successful in their goals. Due to being a scrappy startup, this very often means close collaboration between IT and Engineering, sometimes involving actual software development. What's more (and to the delight of the CTO), Ben has been picking up more development skills and wants to learn Go.

Ben is head of Operations in the Office of the CFO, but what some may not know (even here at Banyan!) is that not only was he in the original group of four that started together in August of 2020 (including the CEO himself!), he had already begun contributing to what would latter become Banyan as early as three months prior to that, in May! (In a fun bit of serendipity, the day that Duncan proposed this dual-support role to CFO Michael Budde, the same agenda item was on Michael's list for that day!)

Ben and Duncan have worked closely together since Duncan joined in 2021, and they are both excited to be having Ben more involved in Engineering in the future.
