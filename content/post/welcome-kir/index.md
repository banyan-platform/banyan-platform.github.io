We have a new member of the Engineering team: Kirill Babkin! Many of us have worked with Kir previously (MediaMath) or have spent time enjoying conversations with him at company offsites, with topics ranging widely over the breadth of Kir's interests. Kir has been with Banyan since May 1st, 2022, serving in the role of tech lead for the Engineering Solutions team. Through his increased exposure of the Go programming language and his deep love of software engineering, Kir has asked for a transfer to Engineering in order to accelerate this learning and make more direct contributions to the Banyan Platform -- and we are _very_ delighted (and grateful!) to have him!
